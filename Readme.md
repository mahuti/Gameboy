Original post: http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=1261.msg11687#msg11687

I created several themes for handhelds living in their natural environments. On desks.

### Requires: 
- Snap: black and white video snaps from emumovies (the green/yellow color is added automatically)
- Flyer: 2d boxart from hyperspin
- Wheel: wheel logos from hyperspin

### Features: 
- Standard images are angled dynamically
- If 2d boxart is not found, original gameboy box is shown
- Themes are 4:3 ratio
- Does not use a spinning wheel (but does use wheel logos)


#### To-Do
- [ ] Modify Theme to work in other than 4:3 Mode
